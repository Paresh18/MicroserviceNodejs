                                             This Project has 3 challenges

I have implmented all the 3 challenges given.

                                               Public Endpoint
/login -->It will give you the login form to enter username and password,It can be any random pair.

                                              Protected Endpoint
                                              
Note**All the below pages will show the webpage when the token is being present in the url header,other if we directly try to access     them then it will display”No token Authenticated”.Or if you change the token manually than”Failed to authenticate token”.   
  
/tokeninfo-It will provide the token value which is generated by submitting the form values to the jsw signin function.
